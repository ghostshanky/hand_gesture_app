# 🚀 Hand Gesture Monitor

A real-time hand gesture recognition desktop application that monitors hand movements using computer vision and triggers system shutdown on detecting a specific gesture (middle finger extended). Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and CustomTkinter for a modern GUI.

## ✨ Features

- **📹 Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Uses MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection
- **📺 Live Camera Feed**: Displays the camera input with overlaid hand landmarks
- **🤖 Virtual Hand Model**: 2D holographic wireframe representation of detected hand
- **👆 Gesture Recognition**: Instant detection of middle finger gesture for system shutdown
- **🌙 Modern GUI**: Dark theme interface with status indicators and event logging
- **🖥️ Full-Screen Mode**: Runs in full-screen by default with F11 toggle
- **📦 Standalone Executable**: Packaged as a Windows executable with custom icon
- **🛡️ Safety Features**: Includes safety notes and status monitoring

## 📋 Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 📷 Webcam
- 🪟 Windows (for executable), cross-platform for source code

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📥 From Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ghostshanky/hand_gesture_app.git
   cd hand_gesture_app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe customtkinter pillow
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### 📦 Standalone Executable

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ghostshanky/hand_gesture_app/releases) page and run `Hand Gesture Monitor.exe`.

## 🎯 Usage

1. 🚀 Launch the application
2. 📷 Allow camera access when prompted
3. 👀 The app will start monitoring in real-time
4. ☝️ Extend only your middle finger to trigger immediate system shutdown
5. 🔄 Use F11 to toggle full-screen mode
6. ❌ Press Escape to exit full-screen

**⚠️ Warning**: This app can trigger system shutdown. Use with caution and ensure important work is saved.

## 🔨 Building from Source

To create a standalone executable:

1. 📦 Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. 🎨 Generate the icon (optional):
   ```bash
   python create_icon.py
   ```

3. 🏗️ Build the executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller main.spec
   ```

The executable will be created in the `dist/` folder.
